            col1: `Our team, consisting of 5 people, had come up with an idea about Fintech. Since Binh Duong province is so-call Industrial capital, in which there are lots lots of industrial area, factories, and the number of workers here increase every year, althought its quantity is already significant. And workers like that always have a enormous demand of spending, especially for emergency need. That is a chance for black credit can have a upper hand on this matter.
            That's why we propose a solution that requires the participation from 3 sides. First of all, the one who need this emergency money, secondly is the enterprise that is hiring this worker, and lastly the worker. The worker can get a hot loan from the bank under the patronition from the company, and that money will be directly paid in their next working month by their salary. A hot loan needs to be:
            - Disbursement money quickly
            - Transparency between 3 parties in this case
            We proposed a solution implementing blockchain, so that the company, the bank will know where is the money is spent, and all banks will have that information, so that they can evaluate the credit point of the borrowing subject, and this points will be shared accross all of the bank joining this network.`,
